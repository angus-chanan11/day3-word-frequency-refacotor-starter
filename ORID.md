I have learnt how to do refactoring, including spotting code smell, and how to fix them with baby step commit and test to ensure the correctness of codes, as well as different hot keys in IDEA for fixing them.

# R
I think that refactoring is very important

# I
Refactoring helps to improve code quality by increasing readability and maintainability. This is important for codes written in the industry, as we do not just aims to let the code work once.

# D
I would be happy to spend more time on refactoring at work. It is quite often that I found the codes hard to add new features, or just to fix a bug due to different kinds of code smell. Refactoring could definitely help me to make the code less painful to maintain.
